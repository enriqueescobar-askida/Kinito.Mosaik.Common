Update the version number in the following places:
1. AssemblyInfo.cs
2. app.manifest
3. Setup -> Organize Your Setup -> General Information : Both Product Name and Product Version
4. Setup -> Organize Your Setup -> General Information : Create new GUID for Product Code (so that it auto uninstalls old version)
